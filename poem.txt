1. It was many and many a year ago,

3. That a maiden there lived whom you may know

5. And this maiden she lived with no other thought

7. I was a child and she was a child,

9. But we loved with a love that was more than love-

11. With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven

13. And this was the reason that, long ago,

15. A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling

17. So that her highborn kinsman came

19.To shut her up in a sepulchre

21. The angels, not half so happy in heaven,

23. Yes!- that was the reason (as all men know,

25. That the wind came out of the cloud by night,

27. But our love it was stronger by far than the love

29. Of many far wiser than we-

31. Nor the demons down under the sea,

33. Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
