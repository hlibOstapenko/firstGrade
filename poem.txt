2. In a kingdom by the sea,

4. By the name of ANNABEL LEE;

6. Than to love and be loved by me.

8. In this kingdom by the sea;

10. I and my Annabel Lee;

12. Coveted her and me.

14. In this kingdom by the sea,

16. My beautiful Annabel Lee;

18. And bore her away from me,

20. In this kingdom by the sea.

22. Went envying her and me-

24. In this kingdom by the sea)

26. Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

28. Of those who were older than we-

30. And neither the angels in heaven above,

32. Can ever dissever my soul from the soul

33. Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
